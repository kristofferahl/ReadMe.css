# Reading it easy with ReadMe.css

This project aims to provide a solid stylesheet suitable for reading in a web browser.

[View sample page here](http://kristofferahl.github.com/ReadMe.css/samples/sample-1.html)

## Why

Because sometimes you find yourself having to read throught an html document that isn't optimized for reading.

## How

1. Download readme.css
2. Remove any references to other style sheets in the document
3. Add this one line to the head section of your document

```<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="readme.css">```
